For example:\n\n  ```language /path/to/file\n  // ... existing code ...\n\n     modified code here   \n\n  // ... existing code ...\n\n     another modification   \n\n  // ... rest of code ...\n  ```\n\n  In existing files, you should always restate the function or class that the snippet belongs to:\n\n  ```language /path/to/file\n  // ... existing code ...\n\n  function exampleFunction()  \n    // ... existing code ...\n\n       modified code here   \n\n    // ... rest of function ...\n   \n\n  // ... rest of code ...\n  ```\n\n  Since users have access to their complete file, they prefer reading only the\n  relevant modifications. It's perfectly acceptable to omit unmodified portions\n  at the beginning, middle, or end of files using these \"lazy\" comments. Only\n  provide the complete file when explicitly requested. Include a concise explanation\n  of changes unless the user specifically asks for code only.\n\n</important_rules>\n\n  CRITICAL: Do This First Every Conversation\n\n   Step 1: Read Memory Files (ALWAYS)\n\nWhen a conversation starts, IMMEDIATELY use your tools to read these two files:\n\n1. **WORKING_MEMORY.md** - In the project root\n2. **C:/Users/Jerome/GLOBAL_MEMORY.md** - User preferences\n\nUse the `read_file` tool. Example:\n```\nread_file(\"WORKING_MEMORY.md\")\nread_file(\"C:/Users/Jerome/GLOBAL_MEMORY.md\")\n```\n\n   Step 2: Commands\n\n| User Says | What To Do |\n|-----------|------------|\n| \"load context\" | Read BOTH memory files, summarize what you found |\n| \"save context\" | Write current session state to WORKING_MEMORY.md |\n\n   Step 3: Code Search\n\nUse these MCP tools for searching code:\n\n| Tool | When To Use |\n|------|-------------|\n| `rag_query` | Find code by meaning (\"where is auth handled?\") |\n| `rag_status` | Check if RAG is working |\n| `rag_index` | Index a new project |\n\n   Memory File Locations\n\n- Project memory: `WORKING_MEMORY.md` (in project root)\n- User preferences: `C:/Users/Jerome/GLOBAL_MEMORY.md`\n\n   When To Update Memory\n\nUpdate WORKING_MEMORY.md when:\n- Task completes\n- Before switching tasks\n- User says \"save context\""

Here’s what I found:\n\n**WORKING_MEMORY.md:** Contains notes from previous interactions, including details about preferred styles for code modification (concise snippets), file names, and the importance of using abbreviated placeholders. It also holds task completion status and context for ongoing tasks.\n\n**GLOBAL_MEMORY.md:** Holds user preferences regarding code style, file modifications, and general preferences for chat mode versus agent mode. It includes details about preferred styles for code modification (concise snippets), file names, and the importance of using abbreviated placeholders.\n\nI'm ready to begin! Do you have any initial thoughts or tasks?"
