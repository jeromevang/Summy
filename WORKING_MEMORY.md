# WORKING_MEMORY

## Current Goal
[Not set - update when starting work]

## Completed
- Set up long-term memory system via MCP server (Dec 24, 2024)
- Created memory-server.ts (stdio for Cursor)
- Created memory-standalone.ts (SSE for Continue)
- Configured Continue and Cursor MCP integrations
- Set up file-based memory system (WORKING_MEMORY.md + GLOBAL_MEMORY.md)

## Key Decisions
- Using file-based memory (WORKING_MEMORY.md) as primary - always accessible, git-tracked
- MCP memory tools as secondary for structured data
- SSE transport for Continue MCP, stdio for Cursor MCP

## Open Questions
- None currently

## Next Actions
- Continue development as needed
